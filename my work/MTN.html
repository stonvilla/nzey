		<p>MTN Rwanda began its operations in 1998, starting out as an<br> exclusive GSM network providing voice and SMS services.</br> The portfolio has exponentially grown to include data,<br> wireless internet, Mobile Money services, Enterprise <br>solutions and other Value-Added Services.</br>

MTN has the largest market and value share in the increasingly<br>competitive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ks5QFUmKOI" >telecommunications </a>industry in Rwanda. It has close </br>to 4 million subscribers and network coverage of 99%, with a</br> footprint that is covered by 4G, 3.75G and EDGE networks as</br> well as an extensive fibre network. The company continues to invest<br> heavily in infrastructure to expand its coverage and capacity</br> across the country and has invested about 130 Billion Rwf over the last 5 years.<br>

MTN also acknowledges its responsibility towards its <br>stakeholders to sustain long-term mutual value. In this regard,</br> the company has established relationships with governments and<br> community groups for partnerships that are geared towards improving</br> the quality of service it offers to Rwandans through<br> its Corporate Social Responsibility program, MTN Foundation. MTN </br>Rwanda has continued to grow from being a generic telecommunication<br> company known for basic telephony to a digital lifestyle-enabling, one-stop solutions shop that supports consumers<br> through every moment and every stage of their life</p>

<h2>Main Objective</h2>
To improve the quality of lives of people through appropriate and sustainable Corporate Social Responsibility interventions in communities where MTN operates

<h1>Purpose of website</h1>
The purpose of an information centric website is to convey specific, helpful information to a specific user/audience so that the reader learns something new or understands a topic better. These websites are geared around more actionable information and may contain “how to’s”, tips and tricks, fix and repair, guidance, support information, directions, instructions.

<h2> The comparisson of my website to other online website</h2>
